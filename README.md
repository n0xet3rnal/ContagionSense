# ContagionSense
ContagionSense is a Jupyter Notebook-based simulation that models the spread of infectious diseases under the influence of public awareness. The project builds upon the classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model by integrating awareness dynamics and applying Fickâ€™s Laws of Diffusion to simulate how information spreads alongside the infection itself.

This model aims to capture the impact of social awareness on epidemic containment strategies, offering insights into the effectiveness of lockdowns, public health interventions, and behavioral changes over time.
